# Notes for polkadot apac hackathon

The code in this folder is most of what has been worked on for the hackathon viz:

1. An authentication server for signing users in with username and password , which we intend to turn into full web3 login with jwts and transaction verification on substrate, but only the username password section is complete.

2. UI that has also been worked on for the hackathon but could not be placed in this folder due to modularisation but is self-contained in the [auth-view](../src/polkadot-apac-hackathon/README.md) folder.
